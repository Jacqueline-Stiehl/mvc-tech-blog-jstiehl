## Description/What I attempted to do

Build a tech blog site where users can read others' blog posts, comment on them, and sign up/log in to submit their own posts. This application follows the MVC structure and uses Handlebars.js, Sequelize and Express-session. I built this application as a way to keep a collection of tech related blog entries. As part of this project, I learned how use Handlebars, Sequelize and MySQL together.
